# The project focuses on examining a dataset related to movies.
# It begins with a general overview of the data and then proceeds to a cleaning process.
# Missing or duplicate data are removed, and any inconsistencies are corrected.
# After the data is cleaned, a correlation analysis is performed to test whether logical predictions are confirmed by the facts.
# This project made it possible to study relationships in film data and understand the data cleaning process in practice.
